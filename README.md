# Power-BI_Supply-Chain-Analysis

Problem Statement:
 
An FMCG company is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.
 
The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and OnTime in full (OTIF) %’ of the customer orders against the target service level set for each customer.

About the Dashboard:
I have implemented a bookmark feature on the product overview page to display key performance indicators (KPIs) over a month. Users can easily select one of the major key metrics from above the visual, such as OTIF% (On-Time In-Full percentage), and the visual will dynamically update to show the KPI over the month. Additionally, users can drill down to view KPIs over a week for more detailed analysis.

Task Performed:
Data Profiling using Power Query
